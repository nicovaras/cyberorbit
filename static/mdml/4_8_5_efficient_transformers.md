### 隼 **Exercise 1: The Quadratic Complexity Problem**

**Goal:** Articulate why the self-attention mechanism in standard Transformers has quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length and its implications.

**Instructions:**

1.  Recall the Scaled Dot-Product Attention: `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax( (QK^T) / sqrt(d_k) ) * V`.
2.  If the input sequence length is `n` and the embedding dimension is `d`, what are the approximate dimensions of Q, K, and V matrices? (Typically `n x d_k` or `n x d_v`).
3.  Identify the matrix multiplication that leads to quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length `n`. What is its computational cost (FLOPs)? (Hint: `Q K^T`).
4.  What are the memory complexity implications of storing the `Q K^T` attention score matrix?
5.  Explain why this quadratic complexity becomes a major bottleneck when processing very long sequences (e.g., long documents, high-resolution images treated as sequences of patches).
6.  **Challenge:** If a Transformer model has a maximum input sequence length of 512 tokens, estimate how many times more computation the attention mechanism would require if the input length were increased to 2048 tokens (4x increase).

### 隼 **Exercise 2: Sparse Attention - Longformer Concepts**

**Goal:** Understand the core ideas behind Longformer's sparse attention mechanism (local windowed attention + global attention) for handling long sequences.

**Instructions:**

1.  Longformer aims to reduce the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Explain its primary attention patterns:
    * **Sliding Window (Local) Attention:** How does each token attend to a fixed-size window of neighboring tokens? How does this reduce complexity compared to full self-attention?
    * **Dilated Sliding Window:** How can dilation be incorporated into the windowed attention to increase the receptive field without increasing computation?
    * **Global Attention:** Why is it important to have some tokens that can attend to the entire sequence (global tokens)? Which tokens might be designated for global attention (e.g., `[CLS]` token, task-specific important tokens)?
2.  Draw a simple diagram illustrating how a token might attend to others using a combination of local windowed attention and a few global attention points.
3.  How does Longformer achieve linear complexity with respect to sequence length for its attention mechanism (assuming a fixed window size and a small number of global attention tokens)?
4.  **Challenge:** Using Hugging Face Transformers, load a `LongformerModel`. Examine its configuration (`config.attention_window`). How would you set up input for a task that requires global attention on specific tokens (e.g., the `[CLS]` token for classification)?

### 隼 **Exercise 3: Factorized Attention - Linformer Concepts**

**Goal:** Understand how Linformer uses low-rank factorization of the attention matrix to achieve linear complexity.

**Instructions:**

1.  Linformer proposes that the self-attention matrix `P = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))` can be approximated by a low-rank matrix.
2.  Explain Linformer's core idea: Instead of computing the full `n x n` attention matrix, it projects the Key (`K`) and Value (`V`) matrices to a smaller fixed dimension `k` (where `k << n`) using projection matrices `E` and `F`: `K_proj = KE`, `V_proj = VF`.
3.  The attention is then computed as `P_tilde(K_proj V_proj)`. The crucial insight is in how `P_tilde` (an `n x k` matrix) is computed and used. The paper shows `Attention(Q,K,V) \approx \text{softmax}((QK^T)/ \sqrt{d_k})V \approx P_{\text{low_rank}} V`. Linformer directly learns linear projections for K and V to this lower dimension.
4.  How does this projection to a smaller, fixed dimension `k` for keys and values lead to linear complexity `O(n*k)` instead of `O(n^2)` for the attention mechanism?
5.  What is the trade-off introduced by this approximation in terms of expressive power versus efficiency?
6.  **Challenge:** If `n=4096` (sequence length) and `d_k=64` (head dimension), and Linformer projects to a fixed dimension `k_proj=256`, roughly estimate the reduction in complexity for computing the attention context compared to standard self-attention.

### 隼 **Exercise 4: Knowledge Distillation for Transformers**

**Goal:** Understand how knowledge distillation can be used to train smaller, faster "student" Transformer models that mimic the behavior of larger, more accurate "teacher" Transformer models.

**Instructions:**

1.  Explain the concept of **Knowledge Distillation (KD)**. Who are the "teacher" and "student" models? What is the goal?
2.  Describe the typical KD process for Transformers:
    * A large, pre-trained "teacher" model (e.g., BERT-large) is available.
    * A smaller "student" model with a similar architecture but fewer layers/smaller hidden dimensions (e.g., DistilBERT) is defined.
    * How is the student model trained? It usually involves a combined loss function:
        * A standard loss on the target task using hard labels (e.g., cross-entropy).
        * A "distillation loss" that encourages the student's output distribution (e.g., logits before softmax, or softened softmax outputs using temperature) to match the teacher's output distribution. Other losses might match intermediate representations or attention distributions.
3.  Why can a student model trained with distillation often achieve better performance than if it were trained on the same data from scratch, even if it's much smaller than the teacher?
4.  Find examples of distilled Transformer models available on Hugging Face Hub (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyBERT). Compare their size and reported performance to their teacher models.
5.  **Challenge:** Implement a simple KD setup. Train a small student MLP to mimic a larger teacher MLP on a simple classification task. The student's loss should include both a term for matching the teacher's logits (e.g., MSE loss on logits) and a term for matching the true labels (e.g., cross-entropy).

### 隼 **Exercise 5: Quantization for Transformers**

**Goal:** Understand how model quantization can reduce the size and speed up inference for Transformer models.

**Instructions:**

1.  What is **model quantization** in the context of deep learning? What does it mean to convert model weights and/or activations from higher precision (e.g., FP32) to lower precision (e.g., INT8, FP16)?
2.  What are the primary benefits of quantization for Transformer models? (Hint: Reduced model size, faster inference, lower memory footprint, potential for deployment on edge devices).
3.  Describe the difference between:
    * **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):** How does it work? Is re-training involved? What are its pros and cons?
    * **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):** How does it work? How does it simulate quantization effects during training to potentially achieve better accuracy for the quantized model?
4.  Tools like Hugging Face Optimum or framework-specific utilities (PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite) often provide tools for quantizing Transformer models. Conceptually, outline the steps you would take using such a tool to quantize a pre-trained Transformer.
5.  What are some potential challenges or accuracy trade-offs when applying quantization, especially aggressive quantization (e.g., to INT8 or lower)?
6.  **Challenge:** Research how dynamic quantization differs from static quantization. Which might be easier to apply but potentially offer less speedup?
