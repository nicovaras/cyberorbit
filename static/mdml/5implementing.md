### 隼 **Exercise 1: A2A Server Implementation Outline**

**Goal:** Outline the key components and logic needed to implement an A2A server endpoint based on the protocol descriptions.

**Instructions:**

1.  An A2A server exposes an HTTP endpoint. What web framework technologies could be used to build this endpoint (e.g., Flask/FastAPI in Python, Express in Node.js, ASP.NET Core)?
2.  The server needs to implement handlers for the A2A protocol methods (e.g., `tasks/send`, `tasks/sendSubscribe`). Outline the logic within a hypothetical handler for `tasks/send`:
    * Parse the incoming JSON request (containing Task ID, Message, Parts).
    * Authenticate/authorize the request based on server requirements (see Exercise 4).
    * Initiate the task processing based on the message content (e.g., call internal functions, interact with other services).
    * If synchronous, wait for task completion/failure.
    * Construct the JSON response containing the final Task object (status, artifacts).
    * Return the HTTP response.
3.  How would the handler logic differ for `tasks/sendSubscribe` to support SSE streaming? (Hint: Return initial confirmation, then manage SSE connection to push updates).
4.  Where would the Agent Card (`agent.json`) typically be served from?
5.  **Challenge:** Sketch pseudocode for the `tasks/send` handler, including basic error handling (e.g., invalid request format, task processing failure).

### 隼 **Exercise 2: A2A Client Implementation Outline**

**Goal:** Outline the key steps and logic needed for an A2A client to interact with an A2A server.

**Instructions:**

1.  Outline the steps an A2A client application or agent needs to perform:
    * **Discover:** Fetch and parse the remote agent's Agent Card from its well-known URL using an HTTP client.
    * **Select Agent/Capability:** Determine if the remote agent has the desired capabilities based on the Agent Card.
    * **Prepare Request:** Construct the initial JSON payload for `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`, including a unique Task ID and the user's message/prompt formatted into appropriate Parts.
    * **Send Request:** Make the HTTP POST request to the server's A2A endpoint URL (from Agent Card), handling authentication as required.
    * **Handle Response:**
        * Synchronous (`tasks/send`): Parse the response, check the final Task status, process any Artifacts.
        * Streaming (`tasks/sendSubscribe`): Handle the initial response, then connect to the SSE stream (or handle events pushed via webhook) to receive `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` and `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` messages, updating the client state accordingly.
    * **Handle Interaction:** If the task status becomes `input-required`, prompt the user/decide on input and send a follow-up `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` request with the same Task ID.
2.  What libraries would be essential for building an A2A client (e.g., HTTP client library, JSON parser, potentially an SSE client library)?
3.  **Challenge:** How would a client handle potential errors returned in the JSON-RPC error response format or network failures during communication?

### 隼 **Exercise 3: Framework Integration (Genkit, LangGraph, etc.)**

**Goal:** Understand how A2A is intended to be integrated into existing agent development frameworks.

**Instructions:**

1.  The A2A repository mentions sample agents and integration code for frameworks like Google's Genkit, LangGraph, and CrewAI.
2.  Explain the benefit of integrating A2A support directly into these frameworks. How might it simplify building A2A-compliant agents compared to implementing the protocol from scratch? (Hint: Abstractions, helper functions, standardized interfaces).
3.  Imagine using a framework like LangGraph (which represents agents as state graphs). How might an A2A interaction be represented as nodes or edges within such a graph? (e.g., a node making an A2A client call, an edge waiting for an SSE update). (Conceptual).
4.  Explore the `google/A2A` GitHub repository. Look for the sample agent implementations or the "Agent Developer Kit (ADK)". What kind of tools or abstractions does the ADK seem to provide for developers using these frameworks?
5.  **Challenge:** If you were designing an A2A "tool" or "node" for LangChain or a similar framework, what inputs and outputs would it need to handle for both client-side calls and server-side task execution?

### 隼 **Exercise 4: Enterprise Security Considerations**

**Goal:** Analyze the security requirements and mechanisms relevant for deploying A2A in enterprise environments.

**Instructions:**

1.  A2A design principles emphasize "Secure by default" and support for enterprise-grade authentication/authorization.
2.  Why is authentication crucial? How does the client prove its identity to the server, and vice-versa? What standard mechanisms might be used (mentioned as parity with OpenAPI auth schemes, e.g., API Keys, OAuth, JWT)?
3.  Why is authorization important? Even if authenticated, how does the server decide if the specific client agent is *allowed* to perform the requested task or access certain data? How might roles or permissions be managed?
4.  How does the Agent Card play a role in advertising authentication requirements?
5.  Consider data privacy. If agents are exchanging potentially sensitive information, what other security measures are essential (e.g., transport encryption like HTTPS, data validation, input sanitization)?
6.  **Challenge:** Discuss the security implications of chained A2A calls (Agent A calls Agent B, which then calls Agent C). How can identity and permissions be securely propagated or verified across multiple hops?

### 隼 **Exercise 5: A2A and MCP Synergy in Practice**

**Goal:** Design a hypothetical application flow that leverages both A2A and MCP to accomplish a complex task.

**Instructions:**

1.  Recall that MCP connects an agent to tools/data, and A2A connects agents to other agents.
2.  Design a workflow for: "A user asks their primary assistant (Agent A) to find the best travel options for a conference, book the flight and hotel, and add it to their work calendar."
3.  Break down the steps, indicating where MCP and A2A would likely be used:
    * Agent A receives the request.
    * Agent A might use **A2A** to delegate sub-tasks:
        * Ask a specialized Travel Agent (Agent B) to find flight/hotel options.
    * Agent B might use **MCP** to:
        * Access flight search APIs (via an MCP server acting as an API tool).
        * Access hotel booking APIs (via another MCP server).
    * Agent B uses **A2A** to return options to Agent A.
    * Agent A interacts with the user (potentially using UI elements defined via A2A parts) to confirm choices.
    * Agent A uses **A2A** to instruct Agent B to book the chosen options.
    * Agent B uses **MCP** again to execute the bookings via the API tools.
    * Agent B uses **A2A** to confirm booking details to Agent A.
    * Agent A uses **MCP** to interact with the user's Calendar tool (via an MCP server) to add the event.
4.  Draw a diagram illustrating this flow, labeling the agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-to-tool (MCP) interactions.
5.  **Challenge:** Discuss the potential benefits of this modular approach (using specialized agents and tools via protocols) compared to trying to build a single monolithic AI system that handles everything itself.
