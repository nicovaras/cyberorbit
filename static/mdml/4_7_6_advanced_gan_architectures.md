### 隼 **Exercise 1: StyleGAN - Mapping Network & W Space**

**Goal:** Understand the purpose and function of StyleGAN's mapping network and the intermediate latent space W.

**Instructions:**

1.  In traditional GANs, the latent code `z` (typically from a standard normal distribution) is directly fed into the generator. How does StyleGAN process `z` before it's used in the synthesis network? (Hint: Mapping Network).
2.  Describe the architecture of the **Mapping Network** in StyleGAN (e.g., an MLP). What is its input (`z`) and what is its output (`w`)? The space of `w` vectors is called W space.
3.  Why is transforming `z` to `w` beneficial? How does the mapping network help to "disentangle" factors of variation in the data, leading to a less entangled W space compared to Z space?
4.  Explain how this disentangled W space facilitates style mixing and better control over generated image attributes.
5.  **Challenge:** If `z` is sampled from `N(0,I)`, is `w` also guaranteed to follow a simple distribution? How might the mapping network learn to warp the input distribution to better match the distribution of variations in real image styles?

### 隼 **Exercise 2: StyleGAN - Style Injection with AdaIN**

**Goal:** Understand how StyleGAN injects the style vector `w` into the synthesis network at multiple levels using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN).

**Instructions:**

1.  What is **Instance Normalization (IN)**? How does it normalize feature maps per sample, per channel?
2.  Define **Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)**. It takes a feature map `x` and a style vector `s` (derived from `w`) as input. How does it use `s` to modulate the normalized `x`? (Hint: `AdaIN(x, s) = scale(s) * normalize(x) + bias(s)`).
3.  In StyleGAN's synthesis network, the style vector `w` is transformed (via learned affine transformations `A`) into style parameters (scale and bias) for each AdaIN layer. Explain how these style parameters are used to inject style information after each convolution layer in the synthesis network.
4.  Why is injecting style at multiple resolutions (different layers of the generator) beneficial for controlling both coarse (e.g., pose, face shape) and fine-grained (e.g., hair texture, skin color) attributes?
5.  **Challenge:** Implement a simplified AdaIN operation as a custom layer/function. Given an input feature map tensor and a style vector (which you'd map to scale and bias terms), perform the AdaIN transformation.

### 隼 **Exercise 3: StyleGAN - Progressive Growing & Noise Inputs**

**Goal:** Understand StyleGAN's use of progressive growing (initially) and per-layer noise inputs.

**Instructions:**

1.  (Historical Context) Original StyleGAN built upon **Progressive Growing of GANs (ProGAN)**. Briefly explain the core idea of progressive growing: How are the generator and discriminator trained starting from low-resolution images and gradually adding layers to increase resolution? How does this stabilize training for high-resolution images?
2.  StyleGAN also introduces **stochastic noise inputs** added directly to the feature maps at different layers of the synthesis network. What is the purpose of adding this explicit noise? (Hint: Modeling fine, stochastic details like hair placement, freckles, that are not well captured by the global style `w`).
3.  How is this noise processed before being added (e.g., scaled by learned per-channel factors)?
4.  **Challenge:** Compare the role of the latent vector `z` (transformed to `w`) and the role of the per-layer noise inputs in controlling the generated image in StyleGAN. Which controls global styles, and which controls finer stochastic variations?

### 隼 **Exercise 4: BigGAN - Scaling Up GANs**

**Goal:** Understand the key techniques used in BigGAN to successfully train very large GANs on large datasets like ImageNet for high-fidelity image generation.

**Instructions:**

1.  What was the primary goal of the BigGAN project? (Hint: High resolution, high fidelity, diversity, on complex datasets like ImageNet).
2.  BigGAN employed significantly **larger batch sizes** (e.g., 2048) distributed across many TPUs/GPUs. Why are large batch sizes beneficial for GAN training stability, especially at scale?
3.  **Orthogonal Regularization:** BigGAN applied orthogonal regularization to the generator's weights. What is the intuition behind this? How does encouraging weight matrices to be orthogonal help stabilize training in deep networks and prevent issues like gradient explosion/vanishing?
4.  **Conditional Batch Normalization (with class embeddings):** How does BigGAN effectively incorporate class conditional information into the generator using shared embeddings that modulate Batch Normalization layers?
5.  **Truncation Trick:** Explain the "truncation trick" used during sampling/inference in BigGAN. How does sampling latent vectors `z` from a truncated Normal distribution (closer to the mean) affect the trade-off between sample fidelity (quality) and sample diversity?
6.  **Challenge:** BigGAN also utilizes Self-Attention layers. Where are these typically incorporated in the generator/discriminator, and why are they beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies in high-resolution images?

### 隼 **Exercise 5: Comparing Advanced GANs to Baseline GANs**

**Goal:** Articulate the main advancements and resultant capabilities of models like StyleGAN and BigGAN compared to earlier architectures like DCGAN.

**Instructions:**

1.  Create a brief comparison focusing on:
    * **Image Quality & Resolution:** How do StyleGAN/BigGAN outputs compare to DCGAN outputs?
    * **Training Stability:** What techniques do they employ to achieve more stable training at high resolutions?
    * **Control over Generation:** How does StyleGAN offer more fine-grained control over attributes compared to unconditional GANs or simple cGANs? How does BigGAN offer class-conditional control?
    * **Disentanglement of Latent Space:** How does StyleGAN's W space aim for better disentanglement compared to the Z space in DCGAN?
2.  Discuss the computational resources required for training models like StyleGAN and BigGAN compared to simpler GANs.
3.  What are some of the downstream applications or impacts that these advanced GAN architectures have enabled? (e.g., realistic face generation, high-fidelity image synthesis, artistic creation).
4.  **Challenge:** What are some of the ethical concerns or potential misuse scenarios associated with the highly realistic image generation capabilities of models like StyleGAN (e.g., deepfakes)?
