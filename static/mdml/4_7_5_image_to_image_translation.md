### 隼 **Exercise 1: Understanding Paired Image-to-Image Translation**

**Goal:** Define paired image-to-image translation and understand the role of cGANs in this task.

**Instructions:**

1.  What is "paired image-to-image translation"? Provide examples of tasks that fall under this category (e.g., edges-to-photos, aerial-to-maps, black&white-to-color, day-to-night).
2.  How is this a "conditional" generation task? What is the input condition `x` (source image) and what is the desired output `y` (target image)?
3.  Explain how the Pix2Pix framework uses a cGAN to learn this mapping from input image `x` to output image `G(x)`.
    * The Generator `G` takes `x` as input and tries to generate `y_fake` that looks like the corresponding real target image `y_real`.
    * The Discriminator `D` takes pairs `(x, y_real)` or `(x, y_fake)` and tries to distinguish if `y` is real or generated, given `x`.
4.  Why is simply using a standard L1 or L2 reconstruction loss between `G(x)` and `y_real` often insufficient for producing realistic images? How does the adversarial loss help?
5.  **Challenge:** CycleGAN is used for *unpaired* image-to-image translation. Briefly explain how its objective differs from Pix2Pix which requires paired data.

### 隼 **Exercise 2: The U-Net Generator Architecture**

**Goal:** Understand the U-Net architecture commonly used as the generator in Pix2Pix and its key feature: skip connections.

**Instructions:**

1.  Describe the overall structure of a U-Net:
    * **Encoder Path (Downsampling):** Consists of repeated blocks of convolutions, (often BatchNorm), and ReLU, typically followed by downsampling (e.g., strided convolutions or max pooling). What is its purpose?
    * **Bottleneck:** The layer(s) with the smallest spatial resolution.
    * **Decoder Path (Upsampling):** Consists of repeated blocks of upsampling (e.g., transposed convolutions), concatenation with features from the encoder path, convolutions, (BatchNorm), and ReLU. What is its purpose?
2.  Explain the role of **skip connections** in U-Net. How do they connect layers in the encoder path to corresponding layers in the decoder path?
3.  Why are skip connections crucial for tasks like image-to-image translation where detailed spatial information needs to be preserved from the input to the output? How do they help combine low-level feature information with high-level semantic information?
4.  Implement a simplified U-Net generator block (one encoder block, one decoder block with a skip connection) using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Verify shapes with a dummy input.
5.  **Challenge:** How does the depth of the U-Net (number of downsampling/upsampling stages) affect its receptive field and its ability to capture context at different scales?

### 隼 **Exercise 3: The PatchGAN Discriminator**

**Goal:** Understand the PatchGAN discriminator architecture used in Pix2Pix, which classifies local image patches rather than the entire image.

**Instructions:**

1.  Explain the core idea of a **PatchGAN discriminator**. Instead of outputting a single scalar for the entire image, what does it output? (Hint: An N x N grid of "real/fake" decisions for overlapping image patches).
2.  What is the architectural structure of a PatchGAN typically like? (Hint: It's a fully convolutional network that maps the input image pair `(x, y)` to an `N x N x 1` output feature map, where each element corresponds to a patch).
3.  Why is using a PatchGAN potentially more effective than a global discriminator for image-to-image translation tasks that require sharp, high-frequency details? How does it enforce local realism?
4.  How does the receptive field of each neuron in the PatchGAN's output layer correspond to the size of the "patch" it is evaluating in the input image?
5.  When calculating the discriminator loss, how are the target labels (real/fake) typically structured to match the PatchGAN's N x N output? (Hint: A grid of 1s for real pairs, 0s for fake pairs).
6.  **Challenge:** Implement a simple PatchGAN discriminator architecture (e.g., 3-4 convolutional layers followed by a final convolution to produce the patch outputs) in PyTorch/TensorFlow. Verify input/output shapes.

### 隼 **Exercise 4: Combined Loss Function for Pix2Pix**

**Goal:** Implement the combined loss function used to train Pix2Pix, consisting of an adversarial loss and a reconstruction loss (e.g., L1).

**Instructions:**

1.  The Generator's loss in Pix2Pix is typically a weighted sum of two components:
    * **Adversarial Loss (`L_GAN`):** This encourages the Generator `G` to produce images `G(x)` that the Discriminator `D` classifies as real (when paired with input `x`). It's similar to the standard cGAN generator loss.
    * **Reconstruction Loss (`L_L1` or `L_L2`):** This encourages `G(x)` to be structurally similar to the ground truth target image `y_real`. L1 loss (`MAE = |y_real - G(x)|`) is often preferred over L2 (MSE) as it encourages less blurring.
2.  The total Generator loss is: `Loss_G = L_GAN + lambda * L_L1`, where `lambda` is a weighting factor (e.g., 100 as in the paper).
3.  The Discriminator's loss (`Loss_D`) is the standard cGAN discriminator loss, trained to distinguish between `(x, y_real)` and `(x, G(x))`.
4.  Write Python functions (PyTorch/TensorFlow) to calculate `L_GAN` for G, `L_L1` (using MAE), `Loss_G_total`, and `Loss_D`.
5.  Why is the reconstruction loss (`L_L1`) important in Pix2Pix? What happens if only the adversarial loss is used for a paired image-to-image translation task?
6.  **Challenge:** Experiment with different values of `lambda` when training a Pix2Pix model (conceptually or if you build one). How does changing `lambda` affect the visual quality of the generated images (e.g., realism vs. faithfulness to the target)?

### 隼 **Exercise 5: Training a Basic Pix2Pix Model**

**Goal:** Set up and train a simplified Pix2Pix model on a paired image dataset.

**Instructions:**

1.  Find or create a paired image dataset (e.g., CMP Facades dataset, or generate synthetic pairs like shapes-to-edges). Preprocess the images (resize, normalize to [-1, 1]).
2.  Implement your U-Net Generator (from Exercise 2) and PatchGAN Discriminator (from Exercise 3).
3.  Implement the loss functions (from Exercise 4).
4.  Set up optimizers (e.g., Adam) for both G and D.
5.  Write the Pix2Pix training loop:
    * **Train Discriminator D:**
        * Get a batch of `(input_image_A, real_target_image_B)`.
        * Generate `fake_target_image_B = G(input_image_A)`.
        * Calculate `loss_D` by comparing `D(input_image_A, real_target_image_B)` (target: all ones) and `D(input_image_A, fake_target_image_B.detach())` (target: all zeros). Update D.
    * **Train Generator G:**
        * Get a batch of `(input_image_A, real_target_image_B)`.
        * Generate `fake_target_image_B = G(input_image_A)`.
        * Calculate `L_GAN` based on `D(input_image_A, fake_target_image_B)` (target: all ones for D's output).
        * Calculate `L_L1` between `fake_target_image_B` and `real_target_image_B`.
        * Calculate `Loss_G_total = L_GAN + lambda * L_L1`. Update G.
6.  Train the model. Periodically save sample input/generated/target image triplets to visualize progress.
7.  **Challenge:** Discuss common failure modes or artifacts you might observe when training Pix2Pix (e.g., blurry images, mode collapse, D overpowering G). How might hyperparameter tuning or architectural adjustments address these?
