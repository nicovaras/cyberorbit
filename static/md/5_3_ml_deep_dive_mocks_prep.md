### Exercise 1: Explaining a Complex Model Architecture

**Goal:** Prepare to explain the architecture and key innovations of a complex ML model (e.g., Transformer, a specific CNN like ResNet, or a GNN) clearly and concisely.
**Instructions:**

1.  Choose one complex model architecture relevant to your field (e.g., the Transformer).
2.  Prepare a short (e.g., 5-10 minute) verbal explanation covering:
      * The problem the architecture was designed to solve.
      * The overall structure (e.g., Encoder-Decoder, key layers).
      * The core innovative mechanism(s) (e.g., Self-Attention, Residual Connections). Explain *how* they work and *why* they are important.
      * Key hyperparameters and their impact.
      * Strengths and weaknesses/limitations of the architecture.
3.  Practice explaining this out loud or to a peer. Focus on clarity and intuition over reciting formulas. Be ready to draw simple diagrams on a whiteboard/digital equivalent.
    **Challenge:** Prepare explanations for 2-3 different complex architectures relevant to Staff roles (e.g., Transformer, ResNet, GNN, potentially Diffusion Models if relevant).

### Exercise 2: Discussing Model/Architecture Trade-offs

**Goal:** Prepare to discuss the rationale behind choosing a specific model architecture over alternatives for a given problem.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider a specific ML task (e.g., image classification, machine translation, sentiment analysis, fraud detection).
2.  Identify 2-3 different model architectures potentially suitable for this task (e.g., for sentiment: Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT).
3.  For each potential model, list its pros and cons regarding:
      * Expected performance (accuracy, relevant metrics).
      * Computational cost (training time/resources, inference latency/cost).
      * Data requirements (amount of labeled data needed).
      * Interpretability / Explainability.
      * Ease of implementation and maintenance.
4.  Prepare to articulate why you might choose one model over the others in different hypothetical scenarios (e.g., scenario with massive data vs. limited data; scenario requiring low latency vs. highest accuracy).

### Exercise 3: Diagnosing Production Model Failures (Scenario Prep)

**Goal:** Prepare to troubleshoot hypothetical scenarios where a deployed ML model's performance degrades or behaves unexpectedly.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider a deployed model (e.g., a fraud detection classifier, a recommendation ranker).
2.  Brainstorm potential reasons why its performance might suddenly degrade in production (after initially performing well). Categorize potential causes:
      * **Data Drift:** Changes in input feature distributions (e.g., new user behavior, external event).
      * **Concept Drift:** Change in the underlying relationship between features and target (e.g., fraudsters adapt, user preferences change).
      * **System/Infra Issues:** Bugs in the data pipeline, feature engineering errors, infrastructure outages affecting serving.
      * **Feedback Loops:** The model's own predictions influencing future inputs (e.g., recommendation echo chambers).
      * **Edge Cases/Bugs:** Specific inputs triggering unexpected model behavior.
3.  For each category, outline a systematic debugging process:
      * What **monitoring metrics** (from 2.7) would alert you to the problem?
      * What **data/logs** would you analyze first?
      * What specific **checks or analyses** would you perform to isolate the root cause? (e.g., compare feature distributions between training and recent production data, analyze model predictions for specific segments, check upstream data quality).
4.  Prepare to discuss potential remediation steps once the cause is identified (e.g., retrain model, update data pipeline, fix bug, implement countermeasures).

### Exercise 4: Explaining Monitoring & Retraining Strategies

**Goal:** Prepare to articulate a robust strategy for monitoring and maintaining an ML model in production.
**Instructions:**

1.  Choose a specific ML system you designed in Subtopic 5.2 (e.g., the RecSys or Search Ranker).
2.  Outline a comprehensive monitoring strategy for this system:
      * **Key Metrics:** What specific operational, data drift, and model performance metrics would you track?
      * **Tools/Infra:** What tools would you use for logging, metrics collection, visualization, and alerting? (Referencing concepts from 2.7 and potentially specific cloud services from 2.1/2.2).
      * **Dashboards/Alerts:** What would key dashboards show? What conditions would trigger critical alerts?
3.  Describe the model **retraining strategy**:
      * **Trigger:** How would retraining be triggered (scheduled, drift-based, performance-based)? Justify your choice.
      * **Data:** What data would be used for retraining? How would new data be collected and validated?
      * **Process:** Outline the steps in the automated retraining pipeline (referencing MLOps tools/concepts from Module 2).
      * **Evaluation:** How would the newly retrained model be evaluated before deployment? (e.g., offline metrics, shadow deployment, A/B testing).

### Exercise 5: Discussing Ethical Considerations and Fairness

**Goal:** Prepare to discuss potential ethical risks and fairness considerations associated with an ML model or system.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider an ML system, either one you designed (e.g., Ad Targeting, RecSys) or a common application (e.g., loan approval, content moderation).
2.  Identify potential **fairness concerns** or sources of **bias**. Where might bias originate (data, features, model algorithm, objective function)? How might the model's predictions disproportionately affect different user groups (e.g., based on demographics)?
3.  Discuss potential **mitigation strategies**. How could you proactively address fairness during data collection, feature engineering, model training, or post-processing? Mention relevant concepts like fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds - conceptual understanding) or techniques (e.g., re-sampling, re-weighing, adversarial debiasing - conceptual).
4.  Identify other potential ethical risks associated with the system (e.g., privacy violations, potential for misuse, lack of transparency/explainability, environmental impact of large models).
5.  Prepare to discuss how you would approach balancing model performance with fairness and ethical considerations in a real-world scenario.

### Portfolio/Practice Guidance: Preparing Mock Interview Answers

**Goal:** Structure concise and clear answers to common ML deep dive and debugging questions.
**Instructions:**

1.  For each exercise above (Explaining architecture, Trade-offs, Debugging scenarios, Monitoring strategy, Ethics):
      * Write down bullet points summarizing your key talking points for a verbal explanation.
      * Practice formulating clear, concise answers (aim for structure like STAR method where applicable, especially for debugging scenarios).
      * Anticipate follow-up questions an interviewer might ask (e.g., "Why did you choose that specific technique?", "What are the limitations of your approach?", "How would you measure the success of that mitigation?"). Prepare brief answers for these.
2.  Focus on demonstrating not just knowledge, but also structured thinking, problem-solving skills, awareness of trade-offs, and production/business context awareness.
3.  Organize these prepared points in your notes for review before actual mock interviews.
