  * **qFlipper Desktop Application:** [Official Download](https://flipperzero.one/update)
  * **Flipper Zero Firmware Options:** Research "Flipper Zero stock firmware vs custom firmware" (e.g., Unleashed, RogueMaster - understand differences conceptually).
  * **Flipper Application Catalog:** Via qFlipper or online communities.
  * **Ethical Hacking/Usage Guidelines:** [EFF Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.eff.org/code-of-conduct) (as a general reference for ethical tech use), specific Flipper Zero community guidelines.

**Test Environment / Tools Needed:**

  * Flipper Zero device.
  * MicroSD card (formatted for Flipper Zero).
  * USB-C cable for connecting to a computer.
  * Computer with qFlipper desktop application installed.
  * Internet access for firmware downloads and research.

### 🔹 **Exercise 1: Initial Setup & Device Activation**

**Goal:** Successfully complete the first-time setup of the Flipper Zero and update it to the latest official firmware.

**Instructions:**

1.  Unbox your Flipper Zero and insert a compatible, formatted MicroSD card.
2.  Power on the device and follow the on-screen prompts for initial setup (if any).
3.  Connect your Flipper Zero to your computer using the USB-C cable.
4.  Launch the qFlipper desktop application. Ensure it recognizes your device.
5.  Use qFlipper to update your Flipper Zero to the **latest official firmware release**. Observe the update process.
6.  After the update, navigate through the main menu on the Flipper Zero to confirm it's working correctly.
7.  **Challenge:** Locate the device information screen on your Flipper Zero (Settings \> About \> Device Info). Note down your firmware version and hardware revision. Why might this information be important?

### 🔹 **Exercise 2: Navigating the Flipper Interface**

**Goal:** Become proficient in navigating the Flipper Zero's menu system and understanding its main applications.

**Instructions:**

1.  Using only the Flipper Zero's physical buttons (Back, Up, Down, Left, Right, OK):
      * Access every main menu item.
      * Enter at least one sub-menu within each main application (e.g., Sub-GHz \> Read, NFC \> Read, Infrared \> Learn New Remote).
      * Find the settings menu and explore options like Backlight, Sound, and Power Off.
      * Practice locking and unlocking the device keypad.
2.  Describe the function or purpose of at least five different main applications visible in the Flipper Zero menu.
3.  **Challenge:** Find the "Passport" feature on the Flipper Zero. What information is displayed there, and what might be its intended purpose?

-----

### 🔹 **Exercise 3: Managing Flipper Applications (FAPs)**

**Goal:** Learn how to install, manage, and run third-party applications (FAPs) on the Flipper Zero using qFlipper.

**Instructions:**

1.  Connect your Flipper Zero to qFlipper.
2.  In qFlipper, navigate to the "Apps" tab (or the FAP manager section).
3.  Browse the available application categories.
4.  Select and install 2-3 different FAPs that seem interesting and safe (e.g., a game, a utility like a dice roller, a simple music player).
5.  Disconnect the Flipper Zero (if needed) and find the installed FAPs in the "Applications" menu on the device.
6.  Run each installed FAP to understand its basic functionality.
7.  Go back to qFlipper and uninstall one of the FAPs you previously installed.
8.  **Challenge:** Research one popular community-developed FAP (not installed through the official qFlipper catalog if possible, e.g., from GitHub) and describe its purpose. What steps would typically be involved in manually installing such a FAP (compiling and copying to SD card - conceptual understanding is fine)?

-----

### 🔹 **Exercise 4: Firmware Exploration (Conceptual)**

**Goal:** Understand the differences between stock and custom Flipper Zero firmware and the implications of using custom firmware. (Research-based)

**Instructions:**

1.  Research the key differences between the official Flipper Zero firmware (stock) and popular custom firmware versions (e.g., Unleashed, RogueMaster, Xtreme).
2.  Identify at least three features or functionalities that are often expanded or added in custom firmware compared to the stock version.
3.  What are some potential risks or downsides of installing and using custom firmware (e.g., stability, warranty, potential for misuse, security concerns)?
4.  What is the general process for switching between firmware types (e.g., using qFlipper or other tools)? You don't need to perform the switch, just understand the steps.
5.  **Challenge:** Some custom firmware enables features that might have greater legal or ethical implications (e.g., broader transmission capabilities). Why is it even more critical to understand local laws and ethical guidelines when using such firmware?
