You're totally right—the original subtopic was too one-dimensional. "Python for Recon" shouldn’t just mean wrapping `nmap`. It should cover automation, passive + active recon, parsing external data sources, scraping, fuzzing inputs, crafting packets, etc. Let’s make this subtopic way more fun, skill-building, and dynamic.

## 📄 PDF: Topic 2 – Subtopic: Python for Recon  
**📚 Resource:**  
- *Black Hat Python*, Chapter 2–3: Recon and scanning  
- [https://github.com/joelhans/black-hat-python-code](https://github.com/joelhans/black-hat-python-code)

### 🔹 **Exercise: Scan Targets and Identify Services with `python-nmap`**  
**Goal:** Automate an initial port scan and process the results.  

**Instructions:**  
- Use `python-nmap` to scan `scanme.nmap.org` with `-sS` and version detection (`-sV`).  
- Extract open ports and the services running on them.  
- Display results in a simple CLI table.  
- Bonus: try scanning a private VM or Docker container.

### 🔹 **Exercise: Build a Passive Subdomain Enumerator**  
**Goal:** Discover subdomains using public APIs.  

**Instructions:**  
- Use a service like [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com/corp-api) or [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) to pull subdomains for a given domain.  
- Accept domain as CLI input.  
- Print all discovered subdomains with timestamps (if available).  
- Optional: save to file.

### 🔹 **Exercise: Scrape and Parse Open Directories**  
**Goal:** Build a small crawler to explore public open-directory websites.  

**Instructions:**  
- Input a known “Index of” URL (e.g., some public FTP or old gov site).  
- Scrape filenames and sizes.  
- Extract file extensions and sort by frequency.  
- Highlight suspicious-looking files (e.g., `.bak`, `.sql`, `.zip`).

### 🔹 **Exercise: Build a DNS Brute-forcer in Python**  
**Goal:** Discover subdomains by brute-forcing a wordlist.  

**Instructions:**  
- Load a subdomain wordlist (like `common.txt` from SecLists).  
- Attempt DNS resolution on each word + target domain (e.g., `admin.target.com`).  
- Log successful lookups and their IPs.  
- Bonus: add a delay between requests to avoid rate-limiting.

### 🔖 **Project: Python Recon Toolkit**  
**Goal:** Build a modular CLI recon utility for passive + active recon.  

**Instructions:**  
- Combine several techniques from previous exercises:  
  - Port scanning with `python-nmap`  
  - Subdomain enumeration (API or DNS brute)  
  - Header tech fingerprinting  
- Let the user choose which module to run via CLI args  
- Add colorized output, export results as JSON  
- Bonus: implement threaded DNS brute-force
