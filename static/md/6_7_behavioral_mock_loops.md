## Subtopic 6.7: Mock Behavioral Interviews Tailored to Staff IC Loops

**Goal:** To simulate Staff-level behavioral interviews, practice delivering prepared STAR+ narratives effectively, handle follow-up questions, and refine communication style based on feedback.

**Resources:**

  * Your prepared STAR+ stories and reflective notes from Subtopics 6.1 - 6.6.
  * Lists of common behavioral interview questions for Staff DS/MLE/IC roles (Search online, Glassdoor, etc. - focus on impact, leadership, ambiguity, strategy, conflict, failure).
  * Mock Interview Partners: Peers, mentors, career coaches, potentially platforms mentioned in 5.6.
  * Feedback Frameworks: STAR, SBI (as used in 5.6).

### Exercise 1: Identify Target Competencies and Questions

**Goal:** Compile a list of key competencies and corresponding behavioral questions relevant to Staff IC roles at your target companies/domains.
**Instructions:**

1.  Review the competencies covered in Module 6 (Project Impact, Technical Influence/Leadership, Handling Ambiguity, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Strategic Thinking, Learning from Failure/Weakness).
2.  Research typical Staff-level behavioral interview focus areas for your target roles/companies (use Glassdoor, interview descriptions, leveling guides if available). Are there specific leadership principles or values they emphasize?
3.  Compile a list of representative behavioral questions for each competency. Examples:
      * Impact: "Tell me about your most impactful project." "Walk me through a project with significant business impact."
      * Influence: "Describe a time you changed someone's mind about a technical decision." "How have you mentored junior team members?"
      * Ambiguity: "Tell me about a time you worked on a project with unclear requirements." "Describe a complex problem you solved."
      * Collaboration: "Tell me about a conflict you had with a PM/Engineer." "How do you work with cross-functional partners?"
      * Strategy: "How does your work align with the company's goals?" "Tell me about a time you identified a strategic risk/opportunity."
      * Learning: "Tell me about a time you failed." "What's an area you're working to improve?"
4.  Have this list ready to use when preparing for and conducting mocks.

### Exercise 2: Structure and Schedule Behavioral Mocks

**Goal:** Plan and schedule focused mock behavioral interview sessions.
**Instructions:**

1.  Find 1-2 practice partners (similar to technical mocks). Agree on the format.
2.  Decide on the focus for each session:
      * Option A: Focus on 1-2 specific competencies per session (e.g., "Today let's focus on Influence and Ambiguity questions").
      * Option B: Simulate a full 45-60 minute behavioral round covering a mix of competencies.
3.  Allocate time: Interview time (e.g., 30-45 mins) + Feedback time (e.g., 10-15 mins).
4.  The designated "interviewer" should select 3-5 questions from the list (Exercise 1) relevant to the session's focus, aiming for questions that elicit the STAR+ stories prepared by the interviewee. Interviewers should also prepare potential follow-up questions.

### Exercise 3: Conducting the Mock Behavioral Interview

**Goal:** Practice answering behavioral questions using prepared narratives, adapting them as needed, and handling follow-up questions effectively.
**Instructions:**

1.  **As Interviewee:**
      * Listen carefully to the question asked.
      * Briefly pause to select the *most relevant* prepared STAR+ story.
      * Deliver the story concisely using the STAR+ structure. Focus on *your* actions and quantified results. Highlight aspects relevant to the specific question (e.g., emphasize the "Action" demonstrating influence if asked about influence).
      * Keep answers focused (aim for \~2-4 minutes per story initially, adjust based on interviewer engagement).
      * Be prepared for follow-up questions probing deeper into specific parts of your story ("What was the hardest part?", "What would you do differently?", "How did you measure X?", "What were the other options considered?"). Answer honestly and thoughtfully.
      * Maintain positive and professional communication throughout.
2.  **As Interviewer:**
      * Ask the prepared behavioral questions clearly.
      * Listen actively to the candidate's response. Does it fully answer the question? Does it follow STAR? Is the impact clear? Is the complexity/scope appropriate for Staff level?
      * Ask clarifying follow-up questions to dig deeper, test self-awareness, or explore aspects the candidate didn't elaborate on. Examples: "Can you tell me more about how you handled that disagreement?", "What was your specific technical contribution there?", "What data supported that decision?".
      * Manage time to cover several questions within the allotted slot.

### Exercise 4: Giving and Receiving Behavioral Feedback

**Goal:** Provide and receive feedback specifically focused on the quality and delivery of behavioral answers.
**Instructions:**

1.  Use the dedicated feedback time after the mock interview.
2.  **Giving Feedback:**
      * Use STAR/SBI framework.
      * Comment on the **Story Selection:** Was the example chosen relevant and impactful for a Staff role?
      * Comment on the **Structure (STAR+):** Was the answer well-structured and easy to follow? Were all parts (Situation, Task, Action, Result, Learning/Complexity) covered adequately?
      * Comment on the **Content:** Was the impact clear and quantified? Was the individual contribution highlighted? Was the level of technical/strategic detail appropriate? Was self-awareness demonstrated (especially for failure/weakness questions)?
      * Comment on **Delivery:** Was the communication clear, concise, and confident? How was the handling of follow-up questions?
      * Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement.
3.  **Receiving Feedback:**
      * Listen actively, take notes.
      * Ask clarifying questions.
      * Reflect on the feedback: How can you refine your stories or delivery based on this input?
      * Thank your partner.

### Exercise 5: Iteration and Refinement

**Goal:** Continuously refine behavioral stories and delivery based on mock interview practice and feedback.
**Instructions:**

1.  After each mock behavioral session, review the feedback received.
2.  Update your documented STAR+ stories (from 6.1-6.6) based on the feedback. Clarify points, add missing details, strengthen impact quantification, or refine the "Learning" aspects.
3.  Practice delivering the refined stories aloud, focusing on conciseness, clarity, and confidence. Use a timer if needed.
4.  Identify any competency areas where you consistently struggle to provide strong examples or clear answers, and focus your reflection or story-finding efforts there.
5.  Repeat the mock interview process regularly with different partners or focusing on different competencies.
