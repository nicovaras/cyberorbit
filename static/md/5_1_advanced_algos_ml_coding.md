### Exercise 1: Dynamic Programming (DP) Practice

**Goal:** Solve challenging problems using dynamic programming techniques (memoization and tabulation).
**Instructions:**

1.  Review the core concepts of Dynamic Programming: optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Understand the difference between top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
2.  Select and solve 2-3 "Medium" or "Hard" DP problems from LeetCode or similar platforms. Examples:
      * Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
      * Edit Distance
      * Coin Change / Unbounded Knapsack variations
      * Word Break
      * Matrix Chain Multiplication (Conceptual understanding and implementation)
3.  For each problem, first try to define the state(s) required for the DP solution and the recurrence relation.
4.  Implement the solution using either memoization or tabulation.
5.  Analyze the time and space complexity of your DP solutions.

### Exercise 2: Advanced Graph Algorithm Applications

**Goal:** Apply advanced graph algorithms or solve complex graph-based coding problems relevant to areas like networking, recommendations, or knowledge graphs.
**Instructions:**

1.  Review common advanced graph algorithms conceptually:
      * Dijkstra's Algorithm (Single source shortest path - positive weights)
      * Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Handles negative weights)
      * Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (All-pairs shortest path)
      * Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's)
      * Max Flow / Min Cut (Conceptual understanding of the problem)
2.  Select and solve 2-3 "Medium" or "Hard" Graph problems from LeetCode. Examples:
      * Course Schedule / Course Schedule II (Topological Sort / Cycle Detection)
      * Network Delay Time (Dijkstra's)
      * Number of Islands / Connected Components (BFS/DFS variations)
      * Word Ladder (BFS on implicit graph)
      * Alien Dictionary (Topological Sort)
3.  Focus on choosing the appropriate algorithm/traversal method (BFS vs. DFS) based on the problem constraints.
4.  Implement the solutions efficiently, paying attention to graph representation (adjacency list preferred) and visited sets.

### Exercise 3: Handling Large Data Constraints in Code

**Goal:** Write Python code that efficiently processes data under potential memory or time constraints, simulating scenarios in ML pipelines.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider a scenario where you need to process a very large log file (too large to fit entirely in memory) line by line to calculate some statistics (e.g., count occurrences of specific error codes).
      * Implement a solution using Python **generators** (`yield`) to read and process the file lazily, line by line, without loading it all at once.
2.  Consider calculating pairwise similarity between a large number of items (e.g., user profiles represented as sparse vectors).
      * Discuss (no full implementation needed unless desired) how you might approach this efficiently. Consider techniques like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) conceptually, or optimizing computations using libraries like `SciPy`'s sparse matrices if applicable.
3.  Implement a function that finds the top K most frequent elements in a stream of data where the stream is too large to store completely. (Hint: Use a Min-Heap of size K combined with a frequency map/Counter). Analyze the time and space complexity.

### Exercise 4: ML Algorithm Implementation Nuances

**Goal:** Implement or analyze core components of ML algorithms to demonstrate deeper understanding beyond library usage.
**Instructions:**

1.  Implement a function that performs a single step of **gradient descent** for linear regression. Inputs: current weights, learning rate, features (X), target (y). Output: updated weights.
2.  Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm from scratch (predict function). Inputs: training data (X_train, y_train), a new data point (x_new), number of neighbors (k). Output: predicted class label based on majority vote among k nearest neighbors. Use Euclidean distance. Discuss the time complexity of prediction.
3.  Explain the core calculation involved in a **decision tree split**. What impurity measures might be used (e.g., Gini impurity, Entropy)? How is the best split point typically chosen for a continuous feature? (Conceptual explanation).
    **Challenge:** Implement the backpropagation calculation (gradient computation) for a simple 2-layer neural network with sigmoid activation (conceptual or with small matrices).

### Portfolio/Practice Guidance: Documenting Problem Solutions

**Goal:** Structure solutions to advanced coding problems for personal review and potential interview discussion.
**Instructions:**

1.  For each complex algorithmic problem solved (DP, Graphs, etc.):
      * Create a dedicated file or note (e.g., in a GitHub Gist, local Markdown file, or within platform submission notes).
      * Clearly state the problem description.
      * Outline your thought process: How did you approach the problem? What algorithms/data structures did you consider? Why did you choose the final approach?
      * Include your well-commented code solution.
      * Explicitly state the time and space complexity of your solution and justify it.
      * Note any edge cases considered or potential optimizations discussed.
2.  Maintain a collection of these documented solutions, perhaps organized by topic (DP, Graphs, etc.) in a private GitHub repository or personal knowledge base. This serves as excellent review material.
