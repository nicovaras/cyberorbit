## ðŸ”¬ Subtopic 7.6: Intro to SIEM Alerting & Basic Rules

**Goal:** Understand the concept of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alerting and create basic detection rules within Kibana or Splunk based on specific log patterns or thresholds.

**Resources:**

* **SIEM Concepts:** [Wikipedia SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)
* **Kibana Alerting:** [Kibana Alerting Docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/alerting-getting-started.html)
* **Splunk Alerting:** [Splunk Alerting Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Alert/Aboutalerts)
* **Your Logging Platform:** Running ELK Stack with Kibana or Splunk Free instance (from 7.3) with ingested & parsed logs.

**Test Environment / Tools Needed:**

* Running ELK Stack (with Kibana access) or Splunk Free instance (from 7.3).
* Ingested logs suitable for triggering alerts (e.g., failed logins, specific error messages, process execution logs if using Sysmon/Auditd).
* Access to Kibana (Stack Management > Alerts and Actions) or Splunk (Search & Reporting app > Alerts).

### ðŸ”¹ **Exercise 1: Threshold Alert - Failed Logins**

**Goal:** Create a rule that triggers an alert if the number of failed login attempts for a single user exceeds a threshold within a short time window.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Query:** Develop a query in Kibana KQL or Splunk SPL that counts failed login events (e.g., Windows Event ID 4625, syslog messages containing "Failed password") grouped by username, within a short time window (e.g., last 5 minutes).
    * **Kibana KQL (Conceptual for Alert):** Filter for failed logins, use an aggregation (e.g., Top values on `user.name`).
    * **Splunk SPL:** `index=* (EventCode=4625 OR "Failed password") | bucket _time span=5m | stats count by user, _time | where count > 5` (Adjust count threshold as needed).
2.  **Alert Setup (Kibana):**
    * Go to Stack Management > Rules and Connectors (or Alerts and Actions). Create a new rule.
    * Choose an "Elasticsearch query" rule type (or Threshold type if simpler).
    * Define the index pattern and KQL query/conditions to count failed logins per user over time (e.g., count is > 5 in the last 5 minutes, grouped by `user.name`).
    * Configure the alert action (e.g., write to index, log, or use a test connector if set up). Set a check interval (e.g., every 1 minute).
3.  **Alert Setup (Splunk):**
    * Run your SPL query from step 1 in the Search app.
    * Click "Save As" > "Alert".
    * Configure the alert conditions (e.g., trigger if "Number of Results" is greater than 0).
    * Set the schedule (e.g., run every 5 minutes, looking back 5 minutes).
    * Configure a trigger action (e.g., Log Event, send email - if configured).
4.  **Testing:** Simulate multiple failed login attempts for a single user within the time window. Check if the alert triggers (in Kibana Alert Management, Splunk Triggered Alerts, or your configured action destination).
5.  **Challenge:** How would you adjust the query and alert settings (threshold, time window) to balance detecting potential brute-force attacks while minimizing false positives from users legitimately mistyping their password a couple of times?

### ðŸ”¹ **Exercise 2: Signature Alert - Suspicious Process Execution**

**Goal:** Create a rule that triggers an alert when a specific, potentially malicious or suspicious process name is detected in execution logs (requires Auditd or Sysmon logs).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prerequisite:** Ensure you are ingesting process creation logs (Linux Auditd syscall `execve` logs, or Windows Sysmon Event ID 1) into your platform, with the process name/path parsed into a field (e.g., `process.executable`, `exe`, `process_path`).
2.  **Query:** Develop a query that searches for executions of known suspicious or commonly abused tools (choose one or two simple examples):
    * **Kibana KQL:** `process.executable : "*\\nc.exe"` OR `process.executable : "*\\mimikatz.exe"` OR `process.executable : "/usr/bin/ncat"`
    * **Splunk SPL:** `index=* (process_path="*\\nc.exe" OR process_path="*\\mimikatz.exe" OR process_path="/usr/bin/ncat")` (Adjust field names based on your parsing).
3.  **Alert Setup:** Create an alert in Kibana or Splunk based on this query.
    * **Kibana:** Use an Elasticsearch query rule type. Trigger if the count of matching events is >= 1 over the check interval (e.g., last 5 minutes).
    * **Splunk:** Save the search as an alert. Trigger if the "Number of Results" is greater than 0. Schedule it to run periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
    * Configure an appropriate action (log, index, etc.).
4.  **Testing:** If possible and safe within a VM, *carefully* run the targeted command (e.g., rename `netcat` to `ncat.exe` if needed on Windows, run `/usr/bin/ncat -h` on Linux). Check if the alert triggers. **Do not run actual malware like Mimikatz.**
5.  **Challenge:** This rule is very basic and prone to evasion (e.g., renaming `nc.exe`). How could you make the detection more robust? (Hint: Look for suspicious command-line arguments, parent processes, network connections initiated by the process - requires richer endpoint data like Sysmon).

### ðŸ”¹ **Exercise 3: Basic Correlation Alert - Login After Failures**

**Goal:** Create an alert that triggers if a successful login occurs shortly after multiple failed login attempts for the *same user*, potentially indicating a successful brute-force or password spray attack.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Concept:** This requires identifying two conditions happening close together in time for the same user: multiple failures followed by one success. This is harder in basic Kibana/Splunk without more advanced correlation features, but we can approximate.
2.  **Approach (Splunk - Easier with `transaction`):**
    * Define a query using `transaction` to group related login events (success/failure) by user within a short time span (e.g., 10 minutes). Then filter for transactions containing *both* failure events *and* a success event.
    * `index=* (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625) | transaction user maxspan=10m | search EventCode=4625 AND EventCode=4624`
3.  **Approach (Kibana - Harder, might need Watcher/Advanced):**
    * This often requires more advanced features like Elasticsearch Watcher or specific SIEM rule types not available in basic Kibana alerting.
    * A simpler, less precise approach could be: Alert if a successful login (4624) occurs, AND a separate check shows > N failed logins (4625) for the same user (`user.name`) happened in the preceding X minutes. This might require two separate checks or a more complex query/script.
4.  **Alert Setup:** Configure an alert based on your chosen platform's capabilities and the query developed. Trigger if the query returns results. Schedule appropriately.
5.  **Testing:** Simulate multiple failed logins followed quickly by a successful login for the same test user. Verify if the alert triggers.
6.  **Challenge:** Discuss the limitations of this basic correlation. What other events could be correlated with login activity to provide stronger indicators of compromise (e.g., logins from unusual geolocations, logins followed by sensitive command execution)?

### ðŸ”¹ **Exercise 4: Reviewing and Tuning Alerts**

**Goal:** Understand the importance of reviewing triggered alerts and tuning rules to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy. **(Conceptual & Review focused)**

**Instructions:**

1.  Look at the alerts triggered by the rules you created in Exercises 1-3 (or imagine common alerts like "Potential Port Scan Detected").
2.  For each triggered alert:
    * Investigate the underlying log events that caused the alert.
    * Determine if the alert represents a **True Positive** (actual suspicious activity), a **False Positive** (benign activity incorrectly flagged), or is inconclusive.
3.  If an alert is consistently generating False Positives:
    * Analyze *why* the rule is triggering incorrectly. Is the threshold too low? Is the signature too broad? Is normal activity being misinterpreted?
    * Propose specific modifications to the rule's query, threshold, time window, or filtering logic to reduce these false positives while still aiming to catch true positives. For example, exclude known safe source IPs from the failed login alert, increase the count threshold, or make the process execution signature more specific.
4.  Discuss the negative impacts of having too many False Positive alerts in a security monitoring environment.
5.  **Challenge:** How would you establish a baseline of "normal" activity for certain events (e.g., typical number of hourly logins, common processes run by administrators) to help set more effective alert thresholds? (Hint: Use visualizations and longer-term statistical analysis in your SIEM).

### ðŸ’¡ **(Optional) Project: Documented Detection Rules**

**Goal:** Research and document a small set of useful SIEM detection rules for common attack techniques or suspicious activities, including the query logic and rationale.

**Instructions:**

1.  Choose 3-5 specific security events or techniques you want to detect based on logs commonly available (OS logs, web logs, firewall logs, Sysmon). Examples:
    * Multiple Firewall Denies from Same Source IP (Potential Scanning)
    * Execution of PowerShell with Encoded Command
    * Creation of New Local Administrator Account
    * Web Server Errors (4xx/5xx) Spike
    * DNS Queries to Known Malicious Domains (Requires Threat Intel feed)
2.  For each chosen technique:
    * Research the typical log events/patterns associated with it.
    * Define the detection logic (conceptually, or as a specific KQL/SPL query if possible).
    * Specify the required log sources and parsed fields.
    * Explain the rationale: Why is this activity suspicious?
    * Discuss potential tuning considerations (thresholds, filters to reduce false positives).
3.  Create a Markdown document summarizing these detection rules.
4.  **Portfolio Guidance:** Host your documented rules on GitHub. The `README.md` should introduce the purpose (example SIEM detection rules), list the rules with their logic and rationale, and specify dependencies (required logs/fields). This demonstrates understanding of threat detection logic and SIEM rule creation principles.
