## Subtopic 5.5: Cross-functional Problem Solving Session Simulation Prep

**Goal:** To prepare for Staff-level interview rounds that simulate cross-functional discussions, requiring the candidate to analyze complex problems, propose technical solutions, discuss trade-offs (technical vs. business), influence direction, and justify decisions considering broader context (e.g., build vs. buy, roadmap, team skills).

**Resources:**

  * Product Management Frameworks (for understanding PM perspective):
      * [Prioritization Frameworks (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://productfolio.com/prioritization-frameworks/)
      * Articles on Product Strategy and Roadmapping.
  * Technical Strategy:
      * Articles/Talks on Build vs. Buy decisions in tech.
      * MLOps Maturity Models (e.g., [Google MLOps Levels](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning%23mlops_maturity_levels)) - Understand different levels of capability.
      * Engineering Blogs discussing architectural decisions and migrations.
  * Communication & Influence:
      * Frameworks for structured thinking (e.g., STAR method for past experiences, Pyramid Principle for structuring arguments).
      * Resources on influencing without authority.

### Exercise 1: Analyzing a "Build vs. Buy" Scenario

**Goal:** Prepare to analyze the trade-offs between building a custom ML solution/tool versus buying an off-the-shelf/vendor solution.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider a hypothetical scenario: Your team needs a robust feature store for your ML pipelines. You could build one in-house or use a commercial vendor solution (or potentially an open-source one requiring significant setup).
2.  Identify the key factors to consider when making this decision. Create a checklist or framework. Examples:
      * **Cost:** Build cost (Eng time, infra) vs. Buy cost (license fees, vendor lock-in).
      * **Features & Customization:** Does the vendor solution meet all specific needs? How easy is customization? Can an in-house solution be tailored better?
      * **Time to Market/Value:** How quickly can each option be implemented and provide value?
      * **Maintenance & Operations:** Ongoing effort required for in-house vs. vendor support quality.
      * **Team Skills & Bandwidth:** Does the team have the expertise and time to build and maintain it?
      * **Scalability & Performance:** Can each solution meet future scale requirements?
      * **Integration:** How well does it integrate with existing infrastructure/tools?
      * **Strategic Alignment:** Does building this align with the team's core focus?
3.  Prepare to discuss these factors, weighing their importance based on hypothetical company priorities (e.g., speed vs. cost vs. customization). Formulate arguments for both building and buying under different assumptions.

### Exercise 2: Choosing Between Competing Technical Approaches

**Goal:** Prepare to compare and justify the selection of one technical approach (e.g., ML model type, MLOps tool) over others, considering technical and business factors.
**Instructions:**

1.  Consider a scenario: You need to build a system to classify customer support tickets into categories. Potential approaches include:
      * Approach A: Simple keyword matching / rule-based system (Fast to build, potentially less accurate).
      * Approach B: Fine-tuning a BERT-based classifier (Potentially high accuracy, requires labeled data, moderate complexity).
      * Approach C: Using a large proprietary LLM via API with few-shot prompting (Quick setup if API exists, potentially high accuracy, API costs, data privacy concerns).
2.  Prepare a comparison framework analyzing these approaches based on criteria like:
      * Estimated Accuracy / Performance.
      * Development Time / Effort.
      * Data Requirements (Labeled data needed?).
      * Computational Cost (Training, Inference).
      * Maintainability / Updatability.
      * Explainability.
      * Infrastructure Needs / Dependencies.
3.  Practice articulating which approach you might recommend under different business constraints:
      * Scenario 1: Need a basic solution ASAP, accuracy is secondary.
      * Scenario 2: Highest accuracy is paramount, moderate development time is acceptable.
      * Scenario 3: Minimize internal infra/ML expertise needed, budget for API calls exists.

### Exercise 3: Defending Technical Decisions to Non-Technical Stakeholders

**Goal:** Practice explaining complex technical concepts and the rationale for technical decisions in simple, business-oriented terms to product managers or leadership.
**Instructions:**

1.  Imagine you recommended Approach B (Fine-tuning BERT) from Exercise 2. A Product Manager asks: "Why can't we just use the simple keyword system (Approach A)? It sounds much faster. What's the real business value of using this complex 'BERT' thing?"
2.  Prepare a concise explanation (avoiding deep technical jargon) that addresses the PM's concerns. Focus on:
      * Acknowledging the speed advantage of Approach A but highlighting its limitations (e.g., inability to understand nuance, requires constant rule updates).
      * Explaining the *benefit* of Approach B in business terms (e.g., higher accuracy leads to faster ticket routing -\> reduced resolution time -\> improved customer satisfaction; better understanding of nuanced issues).
      * Briefly touching upon the required investment (data labeling, compute) but framing it against the expected value.
      * Maybe mentioning Approach C as an alternative if relevant trade-offs were considered.
3.  Practice explaining a different technical concept simply, e.g., "Why do we need a dedicated MLOps pipeline for retraining this model instead of doing it manually?" Focus on benefits like reliability, speed, consistency, and reduced risk.

### Exercise 4: High-Level Roadmap Planning Simulation

**Goal:** Prepare to discuss and contribute to roadmap planning involving ML features or infrastructure improvements.
**Instructions:**

1.  Imagine a quarterly planning meeting. Your team supports several production ML models. Potential initiatives for the next quarter include:
      * Initiative 1: Improve the accuracy of the existing fraud detection model (requires research, data gathering, retraining). Expected impact: Reduce fraud losses by X%.
      * Initiative 2: Build a new personalized recommendation feature for a different part of the product. Expected impact: Increase user engagement by Y%.
      * Initiative 3: Migrate the team's model training pipelines to a new, more scalable MLOps platform (technical debt reduction, faster future development). Expected impact: Improve dev velocity long-term, no immediate user impact.
2.  Prepare to discuss the relative priority of these initiatives. Consider:
      * **Impact:** How significant is the expected business value (X vs Y vs long-term velocity)? How confident are you in the estimates?
      * **Effort:** How much engineering/DS time would each initiative take?
      * **Dependencies:** Are there prerequisites? Does Initiative 3 enable faster progress on 1 or 2 later?
      * **Risks:** What are the technical or execution risks associated with each?
      * **Team Goals/Strategy:** How do these align with broader team or company objectives for the quarter?
3.  Practice articulating a reasoned argument for prioritizing one initiative over another, or suggesting a way to sequence them, acknowledging the trade-offs.

### Portfolio/Practice Guidance: Frameworks for Strategic Thinking

**Goal:** Develop reusable frameworks or checklists for analyzing common strategic decisions faced in Staff roles.
**Instructions:**

1.  Create concise frameworks or lists of questions to ask yourself when evaluating:
      * Build vs. Buy decisions (refining Exercise 1).
      * Choosing between technical solutions (refining Exercise 2).
      * Prioritizing roadmap initiatives (refining Exercise 4).
      * Assessing the maturity/needs of an ML system (e.g., what level of MLOps is appropriate?).
2.  For each framework, include key criteria, trade-offs to consider, and questions to ask stakeholders.
3.  Keep these frameworks handy for reference when preparing for or participating in mock cross-functional problem-solving sessions. They help ensure you cover key aspects systematically.
