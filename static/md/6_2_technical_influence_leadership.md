**Resources:**

  * Staff-Level Archetypes: [StaffEng.com - Archetypes (Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://staffeng.com/book/chapters/staff-archetypes.html) (Understand different ways Staff ICs lead)
  * Influencing Skills: Articles on "Influence Without Authority", stakeholder management.
  * Mentorship: Resources on effective technical mentoring practices.
  * Technical Leadership for ICs: Blog posts or books on the transition to/expectations of senior/staff IC roles.

### Exercise 1: Identify Examples of Technical Initiative

**Goal:** Recall situations where you proactively identified and drove a technical improvement or initiative beyond your assigned tasks.
**Instructions:**

1.  Reflect on times when you:
      * Identified a significant technical debt, performance bottleneck, or inefficient process.
      * Proposed a solution or improvement.
      * Took ownership to drive the implementation, potentially convincing others or securing resources.
      * Saw the initiative through to completion and measured its impact.
2.  Choose 1-2 strong examples.
3.  For each example, structure a STAR+ narrative (using the framework from 6.1):
      * **Situation:** What was the problem/opportunity you identified? Why was it important?
      * **Task:** What did you decide needed to be done? What was your goal?
      * **Action:** Describe the steps *you* took to propose, design, build consensus, implement, and champion the initiative. Highlight proactivity and ownership.
      * **Result:** What was the outcome? Quantify the improvement (e.g., reduced tech debt leading to X% faster feature development, performance improvement metric, process efficiency gain).

### Exercise 2: Identify Examples of Influencing Technical Decisions

**Goal:** Recall situations where you successfully influenced the technical direction of a project, team, or technology choice through technical reasoning and persuasion.
**Instructions:**

1.  Reflect on times when:
      * There were multiple technical options being considered for a project.
      * You performed research, analysis, or built prototypes to evaluate options.
      * You presented your findings and technical arguments effectively to peers, leads, or management.
      * Your recommendation significantly shaped the final technical decision, even if you weren't the formal decision-maker.
      * Consider times you influenced choices regarding architecture, algorithms, tooling, testing strategies, or build vs. buy decisions.
2.  Choose 1-2 strong examples.
3.  Structure a STAR+ narrative for each:
      * **Situation:** What was the technical decision being made? What were the competing options/viewpoints?
      * **Task:** What was your goal in influencing the decision?
      * **Action:** Describe *how* you influenced the outcome. Detail your analysis, communication strategy, how you addressed counter-arguments, and how you built consensus or persuaded stakeholders based on technical merit and alignment with goals.
      * **Result:** What was the final decision? How did your influence contribute to a better technical outcome or alignment? What was the impact of the chosen direction?

### Exercise 3: Identify Examples of Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing

**Goal:** Recall specific instances where you formally or informally mentored other engineers/scientists or significantly contributed to team knowledge growth.
**Instructions:**

1.  Reflect on times when you:
      * Onboarded a new team member.
      * Provided technical guidance or coaching to a junior colleague on a challenging task.
      * Helped someone develop a new technical skill.
      * Led a technical brown bag session, workshop, or created significant technical documentation/tutorials.
      * Performed constructive code reviews that helped others learn.
      * Contributed to establishing team best practices or coding standards.
2.  Choose 2-3 diverse examples demonstrating different aspects of mentorship/knowledge sharing.
3.  Structure STAR+ narratives:
      * **Situation:** Who did you mentor/teach? What was the context or need?
      * **Task:** What was your goal (e.g., help them complete a task, understand a concept, improve code quality, onboard effectively)?
      * **Action:** Describe the specific actions you took â€“ how you explained concepts, paired programming, reviewed work, gave feedback, created resources, etc.
      * **Result:** What was the outcome for the mentee (e.g., successfully completed task, demonstrated improved understanding, gained independence)? What was the benefit to the team (e.g., improved code quality, faster onboarding, shared knowledge)?

### Exercise 4: Identify Examples of Cross-Team Alignment / Collaboration

**Goal:** Recall situations requiring significant collaboration or alignment across different teams or functions (e.g., Eng, Product, Research, other DS teams) to achieve a technical goal.
**Instructions:**

1.  Reflect on projects where success depended on coordinating efforts or resolving dependencies with other teams:
      * Integrating systems developed by different teams.
      * Defining shared data contracts or APIs.
      * Collaborating on a platform migration.
      * Driving a technical standard or best practice across multiple teams.
      * Resolving technical disagreements between teams.
2.  Choose 1-2 strong examples where you played a key role in facilitating this alignment.
3.  Structure STAR+ narratives:
      * **Situation:** What was the goal requiring cross-team collaboration? What teams were involved? What were the challenges or potential conflicts?
      * **Task:** What was your specific role or responsibility in achieving alignment?
      * **Action:** Describe the steps you took to understand different perspectives, facilitate communication, negotiate solutions, define common ground, and drive towards a shared technical outcome. Highlight communication and negotiation skills.
      * **Result:** Was alignment achieved? Was the cross-team goal met? What was the impact of the successful collaboration? How did you handle any disagreements that arose?

### Portfolio/Practice Guidance: Mapping Stories to Competencies

**Goal:** Organize prepared stories by the specific leadership/influence competency they demonstrate.
**Instructions:**

1.  Create a list of key Staff-level leadership/influence competencies probed in interviews (use exercise titles as a starting point: Initiative, Technical Influence, Mentorship, Cross-Team Alignment, etc.).
2.  Review your documented STAR+ stories from this subtopic (and potentially others).
3.  For each competency, map the 1-2 best story examples you have prepared.
4.  This mapping helps you quickly recall relevant examples when asked specific behavioral questions targeting these competencies during an interview (e.g., "Tell me about a time you mentored someone," "Describe how you influenced a technical decision.").
5.  Identify any competency areas where your examples feel weak and proactively seek opportunities in your current role to build stronger experiences or reflect further on past ones.
